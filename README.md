# Machine Learning for Molecular Feature Importance

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on extracting and analyzing molecular features using the RDKit and Mordred libraries. The project demonstrates a full ML workflow from feature engineering to model training and feature importance visualization.

## 📁 Files Included

- `First ML Project.ipynb`: Main notebook that handles molecule parsing, feature calculation, and model training.
- `First_ML_project_Feature_Importance.ipynb`: Notebook focused on computing and visualizing the most important molecular descriptors for prediction.

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **RDKit** – Molecular manipulation
- **Mordred** – Descriptor generation
- **scikit-learn** – ML model training
- **Seaborn / Matplotlib** – Data visualization
- **Pandas / NumPy** – Data handling

## 📊 Workflow Overview

1. **Import and Clean Molecular Data**
2. **Generate Descriptors with Mordred**
3. **Train ML Model (e.g., Random Forest)**
4. **Evaluate Model Performance**
5. **Visualize Feature Importance**

## 🚀 Getting Started
